# MUM sIUD: Mammalian Uterine Monitoring Smart Intrauterine Device

The intrauterine device (IUD) is a stigmatized, yet highly effective contraceptive device. The simple T-shaped design has been the FDA approved standard design with a copper or hormonal (levonorgestrel) contraceptive method in the United States. Many people with uteruses are often deterred from getting an IUD from mention of the painful insertion process and risk of migration, perforation, accidental removal, and breakage upon removal. Many of these risks have low incidence but still affect the consciousness of many people with uteruses considering IUD usage. Additionally, there have been a high number of reports of painful insertion experience and uncomfortable removal process. The insertion process is painful because of speculum usage to wedge the vagina open, forceps usage to pull the cervix allowing the uterus to become parallel with the IUD insertion tool to reduce risk of perforation, and the insertion tool passing through the narrow diameter cervix. The removal process is uncomfortable because of speculum usage to wedge vagina open and the IUD arms bending against the cervical canal as it is being tugged by a thread. The issues have been identified alongside the increasing awareness and placed importance on sexual and reproductive health have been integrated into the design of the smart IUD. 

The driving factors for the market are the increased awareness and importance of sexual and reproductive health for women between 15 and 49 years old. The sIUD is indicated to monitor pH, temperature, and uterine tilt while implanted. Our product serves to enhance the awareness and importance of sexual and reproductive health that is driving the market. When a customer can better understand their own health on a daily basis, they feel more informed and can act to optimize their health. Additionally, our team has recognized the faults of current products such as the discomforts of the insertion process as well as side effects and failures during use, to elevate the quality of current designs.

Future work includes working on the software interface for the device, design and development of a mock uterine environment with the assistance of Amy Degenkolb and Donald Lee from Novo Cuff and Kristin Meyers from Colombia University, manufacturing of the prototype, and testing of the prototype. By mid-June, the goal is to have a fully functional prototype at 3x scale available to be evaluated within the mock uterine environment for efficacy.
